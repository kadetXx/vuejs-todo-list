    <h3>Todo list with Vue js by kadet</h3>
    <p>
      Hi there, I'm kadet, a frontend developer. I started learning vue js yesterday because of some specifications for a project I am part of so I downloaded Brad Traversy's Vue js crash course and tagged along.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, I was so confused and started having thoughts like "Maybe I should have started with react", "Why do people say vue is easy and I'm still finding it so disouraging" but at the end, I was able to figure things out a lil bit and managed to complete this simple Todo list application.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope to do more with vue js as time goes on, bye!
